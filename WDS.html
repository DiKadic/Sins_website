          spending his youthful years at ateliers of local artists at the
          Petrovaradine fortress that overlooks his native town – Novi Sad. But
          the greatest impact made his muse Olja Ivanjicki, famous fantastic

          around ex-Yugoslavia and in few occasions in Europe and America, both

          collective exhibitions, in May and October in Belgrade. A solo
          exhibition at the same “Green Door” gallery in June. All three
          exhibitions were juried by professors from the Art Academy at
          Belgrade. Recognition for artistic achievement and certificate from
          Luxemburg Art Prize in the past three years and one of the winners of
          the third Boomer Art Prize competition. This year – collective
          exhibition in March.
